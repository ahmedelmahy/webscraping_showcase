# webscraping_showcase
In this project, I show case my ability to scrape the web using python. I scraped two popular websites in the Middle East: youm7.com and islamweb.com

## youm7.com
Youm7 is a very popular news website in the Middle East. In the first file, I built a spider to follow articles on the website. 

## islamweb.com
Islamweb is another popular website that provides religious, social and medical advice and consulation.
