# webscraping_showcase
In this project, I show case my ability to scrape the web using python. I scraped two popular websites in the Middle East: youm7.com and islamweb.com. Also I showcase other skills such as : working with CSS and Xpath identifiers; using regular expressions.

## youm7.com
Youm7 is a very popular news website in the Middle East. In the first file, I built a spider to follow articles on the website. In the file I used regular expressions and CSS identifiers.

## islamweb.com
Islamweb is another popular website that provides religious, social and medical advice and consulation. The spider I built was to get the medical consulations (that appear in the form of questions and answers) for using them in a health research project. The spider includes two file : the first (the linker) to find the links to the webpages that include the medical consulations; the second uses the json file the results from the first sub-spider to scrape the links in it.
